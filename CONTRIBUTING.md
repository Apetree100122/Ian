You want to contribute to IAN's development? That's awesome! üëç Here's some information about how to best help:

### Report a bug or missing feature
[Check to see if I already know about it.](https://github.com/rjwut/ian/issues) If not, [submit a new issue](https://github.com/rjwut/ian/issues/new). Be sure to include any relevant details. For example, a bug report should include 1) what you expected to happen 2) what actually happened, 3) a complete list of steps to reproduce the error, and 4) any error message you received (especially stack traces).

### Improve our knowledge of the Artemis protocol
If you're handy with a packet sniffer, you can be of great use helping us [document the Artemis protocol](https://github.com/artemis-nerds/protocol-docs). Create issues on that project with any information you discover (or, if you know HTML, you can submit a pull request on the documentation itself). Improvements to the protocol documentation are eventually implemented in IAN.

### Implement a feature or fix a bug
Are you a Java developer? Feel free to implement a feature or bug fix for IAN yourself! Fork the repository, apply the changes to your copy, then submit a pull request. Note that we're trying to improve our testing coverage, so including unit tests would be appreciated.
